The rules of Mancala
</h3>
The aim of mancala is to get as many balls as possible into your main "pot" (you are blue and your main pot is the one with the big blue 0 in it at the start).<br>
When it is your turn you may click on one of your smaller pots to send all of the balls in that pot to the subsequent pots in the counterclockwise direction.<br>
The balls will be distributed so that one ball goes to each subsequent pot until the balls run out.<br>
<br>
If the last ball lands in your main pot then you get an extra turn.<br>
<br>
If the last ball lands in an empty pot on your side then you capture the balls in the corresponding pot on the enemy's side.
<h3>
